## 2017-11-01 10:27 to 10:42
Just basic setup and metadata cleanup for the project.

## 2017-11-01 10:42 to 10:57
Working on asimple hello world story and thenstarted to pull in libraries I think I will need plus work on a deterministic random number generator

## 2017-11-01 10:57 to 11:12
Added a randomness library and some simple wrappers to keep it simple and deterministic

## 2017-11-02 6:43 to 6:58
Started to work on very basic templates for the Story Circle/Embryo.

## 2017-11-02 6:59 to 7:14
Contniued to work on the framework and functions for generating a story.
I do need to take some hammock time and think deeply about this issue and how to really "solve" it

## 2017-11-02 7:14 to 7:29
Got a basic template and structure working.
Very rough outline that will have to be changed.
I want each episode to have data information that is translated into a string.

## 2017-11-02 7:29 to 7:44
Did Release 0.1.0.
Worked on some theory stuff about what "You" really means.

## 2017-11-02 7:44 to 7:59
Refactored the `story-embryo` a little.
Started to add additional functionality to the `pure-random`.
Might add a `impure-random` until I figure out a good way to deal with the new seed that is returned always.

## 2017-11-02 8:00 to 8:15
Release 0.1.1
Thought a little-bit about the idea of the audience story.
Some interesting ideas but I should focus on what I can do.

## 2017-11-02 8:45 to 9:00
Just thought about how to setup a planner.
Wrote some notes

## 2017-11-02 9:00 to 9:15
Continued to play around with datascript and getting a blockworld example working

## 2017-11-02 9:15 to 9:30
Still working on the datascript but feeling like it will be a good solution. 
I got the precondition for an action figured out.
I should check the goal state function and figure out how to get that to work.
Then there is the effect of an action...
In any case feeling better about it!
Might work on simpler things tomorrow
