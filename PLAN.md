# Plan

From the github issue I created.

## NanoGenMo 2017 issue 65 
> Super excited to generate something interesting this year.
> This year I have a sort of incremental strategy. Not totally sure how much time I can devote but I have some grand plans. The key points are below. 
> - Basic ["Story Embryo"](http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_104:_The_Juicy_Details) structure and episodic chapters. Sort of like [Story Compiler](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015/issues/11) from 2015.
> - Some world state that persists between chapters(Simulationist)
> - Use some planner that takes PDDL so the characters have plans on how to solve issues. This will be sort of difficult to figure out how to setup a planner but I think possible to use or make one if needed
> - "Personal Worldviews" A global view of how the world works would what is actually possible in a story but characters might have incomplete views and while trying to carry out a plan fail. A simple example is a character wants to get from A to B but there is a C in their way. This means their plan will fail and they will have to get a new plan. I think Talespin used something similar.

> - Personality traits. Maybe the four Keirsey Temperaments

## Determinism
I need to find a good library for deterministic random number generation. I want to be able to rerun the storys I had previsouly ran.
Maybe just create a project for that.
